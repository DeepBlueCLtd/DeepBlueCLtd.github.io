      - paragraph: 'Having been entrusted with development of the Fleet Narrative Tool for the Royal Navy since the mid 90’s, the Deep Blue C team have recently upgraded the software to give Office 2000 compliance, together with a feature rationalisation that will allow the narrative-keeper to focus on essential events.'
      - paragraph: 'Support for surface narrative-keeping is complete, and it is hoped that support for submarine operations will follow, supported by input from relevant SMEs. In the future Deep Blue C hopes to utilise increased connectivity to grow the exploitation of command narrative data, allowing sister platforms to register (subscribe) to particular event types. This zero-overhead sharing of status information will improve group situational awareness, using standard web technologies.'
      - paragraph: 'As a technical demonstrator, in 2010 Deep Blue C developed a technical demonstrator for web-based narrative keeping. Have a look <a href="http://debrief.info/GWTDiary/GWTDiary.html" class="primary-link">here</a>. Once the page has opened, try adding 100 narrative entries (<b>Generate 100</b>, from the Utilities menu). You can double-click narrative entries by double-clicking on them, or add new ones from the toolbar.'

      - paragraph: 'In 2003 Deep Blue C developed the first web-based lessons management system in the UK for the Royal Navy, for a very important FLEET customer. DBC succeeded in reaching a hard deadline on a short timescale. To date the system has handled over 20,000 lessons, supporting over 1,000 registered users. The body of lessons has become fully embedded into FLEET business processes.'
      - paragraph: 'Ships returning from deployment universally recognised FLMS as the most effective issue resolution strategy. Deep Blue C has provided ongoing maintenance, and Knowledge Management business process support to the rotating uniformed process owners and administrators. This also ensured accountability, audit, and acting as front-line champion remained at the forefront in a resource constrained environment.'
      - paragraph: 'Ian Mayo also represented the Fleet Lessons organisation at a series of International Lessons Learned Conferences, including a start-of-day Keynote Speech at the 2008 International Lessons Learnt Conference hosted by the Singapore Armed Forces. In true cradle to grave support fashion Deep Blue C also ported all of the data to the defence-wide system adopted by the UK MoD in 2013.'
