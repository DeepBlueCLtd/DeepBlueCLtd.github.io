      - paragraph: 'The Pepys library provides tools to populate and administer a relational database of tactica data.'
      - paragraph: 'An API is provided that does the leg work in parsing data from text data-files, then committing it to the database.  Additional functionality is able to produce a copy of the input file that uses highlighting to report how the data was processed.  Database integrity is maintained through the use of a conversational interface that efficiently enables analysts to specify supporting metadata (such as pennant-number and nationality of warships, or the protective marking on a datafile).'
      - paragraph: 'Once the data is loaded, an admin application is used to manage the data, shielding analysts from the complexities of database management. The admin tool is able to export snapshots for offline deployments, then merge data collected on deployment back into the master database.'
      - paragraph: 'The robust command-line interface provided for both Pepys-Import and Pepys-Admin makes heavy use of numeric options with intelligent default, allowing proficient analysts to quickly move through complex tasks.'

      - paragraph: 'Support for surface narrative-keeping is complete, and it is hoped that support for submarine operations will follow, supported by input from relevant SMEs. In the future Deep Blue C hopes to utilise increased connectivity to grow the exploitation of command narrative data, allowing sister platforms to register (subscribe) to particular event types. This zero-overhead sharing of status information will improve group situational awareness, using standard web technologies.'
      - paragraph: 'As a technical demonstrator, in 2010 Deep Blue C developed a technical demonstrator for web-based narrative keeping. Have a look <a href="http://debrief.info/GWTDiary/GWTDiary.html" class="primary-link">here</a>. Once the page has opened, try adding 100 narrative entries (<b>Generate 100</b>, from the Utilities menu).

The body of lessons has become fully embedded into FLEET business processes.'
      - paragraph: 'Ships returning from deployment universally recognised FLMS as the most effective issue resolution strategy. Deep Blue C has provided ongoing maintenance, and Knowledge Management business process support to the rotating uniformed process owners and administrators. This also ensured accountability, audit, and acting as front-line champion remained at the forefront in a resource constrained environment.'
      - paragraph: 'Ian Mayo also represented the Fleet Lessons organisation at a series of International Lessons Learned Conferences, including a start-of-day Keynote Speech at the 2008 International Lessons Learnt Conference hosted by the Singapore Armed Forces. In true cradle to grave support fashion Deep Blue C also ported all of the data to the defence-wide system adopted by the UK MoD in 2013.'
